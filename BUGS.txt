Oroboros - Known bugs file
==========================

The fixed stars can randomly crash (segfault) the application.
I suspect this is due to an unconsistent fixstars.cat file pointer
management inside the swisseph itself. See chartcalc.py file.
Workaround: close sqlite db before calls to fixstars.

The geonames.org query system doesnt work with Qt version 4.4.0.
At least for me. Everything ok with previous versions.

I wish to get back some feedback about bugs. Even noobuntu users.
Please send mail to stnsls@gmail.com. Thanks in advance.
